I also learned for my part to make basic HTTP requests to make the game's leaderboard.\r\n\r\nThe goal in this game is to eat all the pink dots by passing over them with the snake's head (in red). Once every dot has been eaten, the game restarts, but keeps the player's score and increases the speed of the snake and the number of dots. Eating a dot makes the snake grow in length; if its head touches a part of its body, the game is over. On your first game, you will be asked to enter a nickname, then your highscore will be saved in the leaderboard.\r\n\r\n+ Personnal project, October 2017\r\n+ Snake game, 2D (top-down view), 1 player\r\n+ Plateform : Adobe Flash Player\r\n+ Features :\r\n    - Progressive difficulty\r\n    - Online leaderboard\r\n+ Technology stack :\r\n    - ActionScript 3\r\n    - Adobe Flash Player\r\n    - Adobe Animate\r\n\r\n![](°project-image°)"}}]);
