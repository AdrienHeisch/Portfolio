We also had to find and implement a unique feature to the game: mine was the capacity to deflect enemy projectiles.\r\n\r\nThe controls are given in the game. It is possible to use a gamepad. The "special" capacity must be activated when a projectile is about to hit the player; it will then be sent back to the enemy, damaging its armour. Once the armour is destroyed, the player can eliminate the enemy by shooting at it.\r\n\r\nIf you find the game too difficult (it probably is), you can press G to become invincible and see the end of the level and the boss fight.\r\n\r\n+ Study project, December 2017 - February 2018\r\n+ Shoot them up, 2D (side view), 1 player\r\n+ Plateform : Adobe Flash Player\r\n+ Features :\r\n    - A fully implemented classic shoot them up gameplay\r\n    - 4 different enemies including 1 boss, 3 weapon levels\r\n    - Unique gameplay element : reflect shots to destroy the enemies\r\n+ Technology :\r\n    - ActionScript 3\r\n    - Adobe Flash Player\r\n    - Adobe Animate\r\n\r\n![](°project-image°)'}}]);
