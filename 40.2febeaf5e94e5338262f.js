This has been an opportunity to assist them on multiple challenges of the front-end part of the project (assets loading, server-client communication, animation...), which proved to be very rewarding. I have also written the back-end part of the project.\r\n\r\nTo play the game, enter a nickname in the dialog, then click on the "Play" button and create a new room ("New" button). Then, open the game in a new browser window (or ask someone else to join you) and join this room. Once the game starts, each player must drag a card to the grey area in the center of the screen. The round is then resolved following a few rules (for example, the high blow beats the low blow, the parry blocks some damages...). In the case where two players use the same attack, they will have to click as fast as they can to win the round. The first player whose health reaches 0 loses the game.\r\n\r\n+ Study project, March 2018\r\n+ Card game, 2D (side view), 2 players\r\n+ Plateform : Web (desktop only)\r\n+ Features :\r\n    - Authoritative server, impossible to cheat\r\n    - Room system, allowing to join another player\r\n+ Technology stack :\r\n    - Javascript ES5\r\n    - HTML DOM + JQuery\r\n    - CSS3 Keyframes\r\n    - Node.js\r\n    - Websockets\r\n\r\n![](°project-image°)'}}]);
