This is a clone of the game [Mmm Fingers](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.mmmfingers&hl=fr "Google Play"), where one must evade with finger control obstacles that appear on the screen, for which I've added an avatar for the player.

This is mainly a game design project, within the context of Isart Digital : our goal was to make the game more engaging, so I added a cute character to replace the black dot that followed the finger of the player, and also some new obtacles.
