An app to set daily objectives for the time spent on each activity.

This project is still in progress and not very self explainatory. To create a category, click on the pink button in the bottom-left corner of the screen, then enter a name (e.g.: "Music"). Then, to create a timer, click on the "+" button on the category that just appeared, and enter a name (e.g.: "Guitar"). You can then give it a goal ("..." then "Set goal"). The timer will now display its goal's completion automatically.

When it's finished, this app should be able to save its state from one session to another and to display some stats about how often you succeed in completing your objectives.
