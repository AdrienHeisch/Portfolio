After a game design project where we created a variant of the classic game [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban "Wikipedia") as a paper prototype, I decided to program the game so that every student could implement his/her own feature, thus developing my familiarity with the concept of a code usable by other developers, even if this is more a template than a library or an API.

The blue square represents the player, the brown squares are boxes, and the red squares are the location on which the boxes must be placed. The goal is to push each box onto a storage location.
