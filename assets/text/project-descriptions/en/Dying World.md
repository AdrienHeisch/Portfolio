Dying World is the first project of my second year at Isart Digital. It is a [run and gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up#Run_and_gun "Wikipedia") created by a team made of 3 game designers and developers like me, 3 level designers and 6 artists.

My role on this project was firstly to design the game. We decided not to add major gameplay mechanics and to stick with classic weapons and enemy behaviours in order to be able to deliver a finished product by the end of the project. My main task was to implement the gameplay : character movement, level generation, enemies behaviours, collectibles...

The goal in this game is to get to the end of the level on the right by getting past the obstacles and enemies you will meet. If you play on a computer, use the arrow keys to move, the space bar to jump and the F key to shoot.

While the game is quite well polished, there are still some stability issues to be fixed : if it crashes at the end of a level, just open it again.
