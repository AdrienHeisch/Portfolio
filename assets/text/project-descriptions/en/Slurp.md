This is the biggest project of my first year at Isart Digital, a [shoot them up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up "Wikipedia") developed in collaboration with artists and sound designers from the school.

With part of the project being provided by the school (assets loading, code structure...), the work to be done was exclusively gameplay programming. We also had to find and implement a unique feature to the game: mine was the capacity to deflect enemy projectiles.

The controls are given in the game. It is possible to use a gamepad. The "special" capacity must be activated when a projectile is about to hit the player; it will then be sent back to the enemy, damaging its armour. Once the armour is destroyed, the player can eliminate the enemy by shooting at it.

If you find the game too difficult (it probably is), you can press G to become invincible and see the end of the level and the boss fight.
