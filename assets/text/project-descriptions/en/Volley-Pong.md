A rewriting of [Pong](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong "Wikipedia") to which I added a net and some gravity. 
This game is multiplayer, so you need at least two people to fully enjoy it. You can also open two tabs in your browser.

You can see the keyboard controls by moving your mouse to the upper-left corner of the game window.  
To play on a touch screen, you have to hold your phone in landscape orientation. You can then use your left thumb to move by holding it on the screen and moving it, and your right thumb to jump by tapping the screen.
