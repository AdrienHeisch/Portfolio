NotSpaceWar is a game that modernises and accelerates the gameplay of the classic [SpaceWar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar! "Wikipedia").

[The original game](https://github.com/AdrienHeisch/NotSpaceWarAS3 "GitHub") was made using Actionscript3 and Adobe Flash (in 2017 !). I had already ported it to HTML5 using [Haxe/OpenFL](https://github.com/AdrienHeisch/NotSpaceWarHx "GitHub"), but this is a complete remake using the Unity game engine with C# scripting.

The goal is to be the last ship on screen. The controls for the first player are : Z to move forward, Q to rotate to the right, D to rotate to the left, T to speed up, and Y to shoot. For the second player, respectively, up arrow, left arrow, right arrow, and on the number pad, 2 to speed up, 3 to shoot. Games are fast-paced, press space to restart when the game is over.
