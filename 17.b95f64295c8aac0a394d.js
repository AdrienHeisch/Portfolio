"Wikipedia").\r\n\r\n[The original game](https://github.com/AdrienHeisch/NotSpaceWarAS3 "GitHub") was made using Actionscript3 and Adobe Flash (in 2017 !). I had already ported it to HTML5 using [Haxe/OpenFL](https://github.com/AdrienHeisch/NotSpaceWarHx "GitHub"), but this is a complete remake using the Unity game engine with C# scripting.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to be the last ship on screen. The controls for the first player are : Z to move forward, Q to rotate to the right, D to rotate to the left, T to speed up, and Y to shoot. For the second player, respectively, up arrow, left arrow, right arrow, and on the number pad, 2 to speed up, 3 to shoot. Games are fast-paced, press space to restart when the game is over.\r\n\r\n+ Personnal project, January 2019\r\n+ Plateform : Unity\r\n+ Space combat game, 2D (top-down view), 1 to 2 players\r\n+ Features :\r\n    - Ships artificial intelligence\r\n    - Physic modelization of the movements\r\n    - Dynamic gameplay, hard to master\r\n+ Technology stack :\r\n    - C#\r\n    - Unity\r\n\r\n![](°project-image°)'}}]);
