The controls for the first player are : Z to move forward, Q to rotate to the right, D to rotate to the left, T to speed up, and Y to shoot. For the second player, respectively, up arrow, left arrow, right arrow, and on the number pad, 2 to speed up, 3 to shoot. Games are fast-paced, press space to restart when the game is over. Beware, the AI is hard to beat !\r\n\r\n+ Personnal project, Avril 2018\r\n+ Space combat game, 2D (top-down view), 1 to 2 players\r\n+ Plateforms : Adobe Flash Player, Web, Android, Windows\r\n+ Technology stack :\r\n    - [Haxe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haxe "Wikipedia")\r\n    - [OpenFL](http://www.openfl.org/ "openfl.org")\r\n+ Known issues :\r\n    - The framerate is not capped, so the game will run too fast on a 120Hz screen. This is caused by a misconception from the original project.\r\n\r\n![](°project-image°)'}}]);
